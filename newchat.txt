# MicroLoan Manager - Complete Project Context Summary

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Enterprise-grade microloan management mobile application** built with React Native + Expo + Supabase. Serves three user types with role-based access control and comprehensive loan management workflows.

### User Roles & Workflows:
- **Super Admin (Project Owner)**: Manages lenders, oversees all operations, analytics
- **Lenders (Loan Officers)**: Create borrowers, manage loans, record payments, track EMIs
- **Borrowers (Customers)**: View loans, track EMIs, make payments, manage documents

---

## 🏗️ CURRENT WORKING STATE (PHASE 1 COMPLETE)

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED:
- **Authentication System**: Role-based login/registration with email verification
- **Database Architecture**: PostgreSQL with RLS, 7 core tables, proper relationships
- **Super Admin Access**: `aarje2050@gmail.com` / `Rajesh@321` (immediate login)
- **Borrower Registration**: Self-registration → email verification → login
- **Lender Approval Workflow**: Registration → email verification → admin approval → login
- **Lender Management Interface**: Super admin can approve/reject pending lenders
- **Hybrid Storage Solution**: SecureStore + AsyncStorage for auth tokens >2048 bytes
- **Error-Free RLS Policies**: Fixed infinite recursion issues

### 🔐 AUTHENTICATION FLOWS:
```
Super Admin: Login → Immediate access (no verification needed)
Borrower: Register → Email verification → Login  
Lender: Register → Email verification → Admin approval → Login
```

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

### Core Tables (PostgreSQL + Supabase):
```sql
users (id, email, role, phone, full_name, active, email_verified, pending_approval)
user_profiles (user_id, avatar_url, address, kyc_status)
borrowers (user_id, lender_id, credit_score, employment_type, monthly_income)
loans (borrower_id, loan_number, principal_amount, interest_rate, tenure_months, status)
emis (loan_id, emi_number, due_date, amount, status, paid_amount)
payments (loan_id, amount, payment_date, payment_method, recorded_by)
documents (borrower_id, document_type, file_url, verification_status)
```

### 🔥 CRITICAL DATABASE RULES:
- **ID Matching**: `auth.users.id` MUST match `users.id` (foreign key dependencies)
- **RLS Policies**: Use roles `anon`, `authenticated`, `service_role` (NOT `public`)
- **No Recursive Queries**: RLS policies must NEVER query same table they're applied to
- **Service Functions**: Use `SECURITY DEFINER` functions to bypass RLS when needed

### Working Database Functions:
- `approve_lender(email)`: Activates pending lenders
- `sync_email_verification()`: Syncs auth.users verification to users table
- `create_user_profile()`: Bypasses RLS for user creation

## 📱 TECHNICAL STACK

### Frontend:
- **React Native + Expo SDK 53** (TypeScript strict mode)
- **React Query v5** + React Context (state management)
- **React Native Elements 3.4.3** (UI components)
- **React Navigation 6** (type-safe navigation)

### Backend:
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Row Level Security** (RLS) for data access control
- **Hybrid Storage**: SecureStore + AsyncStorage

## 🚦 CURRENT STATUS & NEXT PHASES

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE (Foundation):
- Authentication system with email verification
- Role-based navigation and access control
- Lender approval workflow in ManageLendersScreen
- Clean database with only super admin for testing

### 🔜 PHASE 2 (Next Priority - Dashboard Content):
- **Lender Dashboards**: Create/manage borrowers, loan creation wizard
- **Super Admin Analytics**: System metrics, lender performance tracking
- **Borrower Dashboards**: Loan overview, EMI schedules, payment history

### 🔜 PHASE 3 (Core Loan Operations):
- EMI calculation engine and payment tracking
- Document upload/verification system
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### 🔜 PHASE 4 (Advanced Features):
- Push notifications for EMI reminders
- Offline data synchronization
- Export functionality (PDF reports)

### 💡 FUTURE CONSIDERATION (Phase 5):
- Multi-tier lending system (Super Admin → Lender → Borrower capital flow)
- Can be added later without conflicts to existing architecture

## 🛡️ SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES ESTABLISHED

### Authentication Security:
- **JWT-based auth** with automatic token refresh
- **Role-based access control** at database level (RLS)
- **Email verification** required for all users except super admin
- **Admin approval** required for lenders before activation

### Database Security:
- **Row Level Security** enabled on all tables
- **Soft deletes** (deleted_at timestamps) instead of hard deletes
- **Audit trails** with auto-timestamps and user tracking
- **Input validation** at both client and server level

### Code Quality Standards:
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **Single responsibility** components and services
- **Enterprise error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching

---

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### RLS Policy Issues:
- **Problem**: Infinite recursion in policies
- **Solution**: Never query same table from within its own RLS policy

### Authentication Errors:
- **Problem**: "User profile not found" 
- **Solution**: Check ID matching between auth.users and users table

### Storage Issues:
- **Problem**: Auth tokens >2048 bytes fail in SecureStore
- **Solution**: Use hybrid SecureStore + AsyncStorage approach

### Email Verification:
- **Problem**: Dual emails during registration
- **Solution**: Use Supabase's built-in verification, disable custom emails

---

## 🧪 TESTING ENVIRONMENT

### Current Test Data:
- **Clean database** with only super admin: `aarje2050@gmail.com`
- **Development mode**: `npx expo start --tunnel` for iPhone testing
- **Email verification**: Works via Supabase's built-in system

### Test Workflows:
1. **Super Admin**: Login immediately, manage lenders, approve applications
2. **Borrower Registration**: Complete self-service flow
3. **Lender Registration**: Email verification + admin approval workflow

---

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- Check user status
SELECT email, role, active, email_verified, pending_approval FROM users WHERE email = 'email@example.com';

-- Approve lender manually  
SELECT approve_lender('email@example.com');

-- Clean test data (keep only super admin)
DELETE FROM users WHERE email != 'aarje2050@gmail.com';
```

### Development:
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel  # For iPhone testing
npm run type-check       # TypeScript validation
```
